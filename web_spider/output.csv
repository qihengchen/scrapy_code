5.0,3 users,Arts & lifestyle,Buddha Says,Agrahyah Technologies,"Speaking Buddha is an audio library of Buddhist preaching. Buddhist sermons are such simple and enlightening that one does not need to be a Buddhist. The preachings create a positive vibe and energy in people who listen to them, and encourage them to lead a better life and do good deeds.

Some feel good Buddhist preachings on the Speaking Buddha are:

·       We ordinary people can see neither our own eyelashes, which are so close, nor the heavens in the distance. Likewise, we do not see that the Buddha exists in our own hearts.

·       If the minds of living beings are impure, their land is also impure, but if their minds are pure, so is their land. There are not two lands, pure or impure in themselves. The difference lies solely in the good or evil of our minds.

·       Suffer what there is to suffer, enjoy what there is to enjoy. Regard both suffering and joy as facts of life, and continue chanting Nam Myoho Renge Kyo, no matter what happens. How could this be anything other than the boundless joy of the Law?

·       Your practice of the Buddhist teachings will not relieve you of the sufferings of birth and death in the least unless you perceive the true nature of your life. If you seek enlightenment outside yourself, then your performing even ten thousand practices and ten thousand good deeds will be in vain.

·       Just as cherry, plum, peach and damson blossoms all possess their own unique qualities, each person is unique. We cannot become someone else. The important thing is that we live true to ourselves and cause the great flower of our lives to blossom.

·       Before comparing yourself with others, win the battle with yourself. Strive to be better today than yesterday, and better tomorrow than today."

Welcome to the All Things Hair app, your online hair advisor! Our beauty editors at Unilever love trying out hundreds of styles and products to give you the best hair tips and inspiration.

Once you’ve enabled All Things Hair, you can explore the three key features:

1. A free search
You can ask and find out everything about any hairstyle and get specific haircare advice too. Just say what you have in mind:

‘Advice on wedding hairstyles’
‘Tell me what hairstyles look good with thin hair’
‘Show me Dutch braids’
‘Advice for summer hair color ideas’
‘Help me with dandruff’
‘How do I do natural hair updos’ 
‘How to deal with split ends’

2. Discover a new look, and find tutorials to help you

If you’re not sure about how to style your hair, we can suggest the perfect look based on your hair type, an upcoming event, or even the time of the year. If you feel inspired to try out a hairstyle, you will have access to tutorials that will guide you through the process step by step, giving you time to complete each one. You can pause & resume; it will remember where you were. 

Just say ‘inspire me’. You can always go back to searching for a new hairstyle at any time by saying ‘find another look’, or go back to the menu. 

3. Hair care and product tips 

We can give you instant access to essential hair care information and must-have products.  We can then email you the haircare advice and style guides so you can refer to them later – just say ‘Send me the look’. We can then send the products used to your inbox.

If you’d prefer to not receive emails, you can change the settings. You can turn them back on if you change your mind.

Enabling All Things Hair is simple. Tap the green ‘Install’ button on this page, enter your name & email address (so we can send you your products and tips), verify your account (click the link in the email we send), and get started with ‘Google, talk to All Things Hair!’.

For lots more handy information on how to use this skill, head to www.allthingshair.com or search ‘All Things Hair’. We hope you’ll enjoy it. If you like it, the best way to tell us is with some stars."
