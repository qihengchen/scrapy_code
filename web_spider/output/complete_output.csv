Buddhist sermons are such simple and enlightening that one does not need to be a Buddhist. The preachings create a positive vibe and energy in people who listen to them, and encourage them to lead a better life and do good deeds.

Some feel good Buddhist preachings on the Speaking Buddha are:

·       We ordinary people can see neither our own eyelashes, which are so close, nor the heavens in the distance. Likewise, we do not see that the Buddha exists in our own hearts.

·       If the minds of living beings are impure, their land is also impure, but if their minds are pure, so is their land. There are not two lands, pure or impure in themselves. The difference lies solely in the good or evil of our minds.

·       Suffer what there is to suffer, enjoy what there is to enjoy. Regard both suffering and joy as facts of life, and continue chanting Nam Myoho Renge Kyo, no matter what happens. How could this be anything other than the boundless joy of the Law?

·       Your practice of the Buddhist teachings will not relieve you of the sufferings of birth and death in the least unless you perceive the true nature of your life. If you seek enlightenment outside yourself, then your performing even ten thousand practices and ten thousand good deeds will be in vain.

·       Just as cherry, plum, peach and damson blossoms all possess their own unique qualities, each person is unique. We cannot become someone else. The important thing is that we live true to ourselves and cause the great flower of our lives to blossom.

·       Before comparing yourself with others, win the battle with yourself. Strive to be better today than yesterday, and better tomorrow than today."

3.2,6 users,Food & drink,Sous Chef,backwardsE LLC,"This assistant is for the modern home cook who uses their phone as their primary recipe source.  The problem with using your phone as a cook book is that you constantly have to use your hands to turn it on.  This usually involves having to wash and dry your hands, then you have to enter your password because your fingerprint reader doesn't work with damp digits.  It's a huge pain, but no more!

Now you can access your recipes with simple spoken commands.  Simply use the Sous Chef Recipes App available in the Apple App Store and on Google Play to enter your recipes.  Then use your Google Assistant device to interact with your recipes in a natural way.  First start up the assistant.

“Ok, Google, talk to Sous Chef.”

Once you've linked your email address to the app and this assistant the first thing you'll want to do is add a recipe.  The app allows you to easily load recipes from the most popular food websites.  Note some websites may require their own login.  You can also load recipes from smaller websites like blogs or enter your own recipes manually as well.

Once you've added a recipe you'll need to go shopping.  The companion app has a built in shopping list which allows you to select the ingredients you'll need for each recipe.  You can type in other shopping items as well or you can add them with your Google Assistant device:

“Add sour cream to my shopping list.”

When you're ready to begin making your recipe you'll want to open it first.  You can do this in the app or you can simply ask your assistant to do it for you:

""Open the burger sauce recipe.""

Hint: Sous is a French word that sounds like the English name Sue.

You can also check which recipe you have open.

“What my current recipe is.”

Once your recipe is open you'll be able to interact with the ingredients.  Here are some examples of things you can say:

“List ingredients.”

“How much baking powder?”

“How many potatoes?”

Hint: if your assistant doesn't find what you're looking for but you know it's there use the app to simplify the text.  For example you might change “¼ cup (4 oz) unsalted butter melted and cooled” to “4 ounces unsalted butter”.

Next you'll want to go through the steps of the recipe.  For example you can use the following commands:

“Go to the first step.”

“Go to the next step.”

“Go to the fourth step.”

“Repeat step.”

Recipes in the Sous Chef App also have a description and notes.  You can access these by asking your assistant to read them aloud:

“Read the description.”

“Read notes.”

Hint: Sous Chef will get better at recognizing your recipes over time.  The more recipes that are added the more text we'll have to analyze to improve our speech recognition models.

That's all there is to it, hands free recipe access at your command.  It's like having your own personal assistant in the kitchen.  With all of Google Assistants other great cooking features like timers and measurement conversions you'll be cooking with ease in no time.

If you have any questions, comments or ideas about new features, please don't hesitate to contact us via the app or by emailing help@souschef.recipes.  Also be sure to check out the helpful “How To” videos available in the app or by visiting http://souschef.recipes.

With today’s technology, access to information, the ability to communicate from all parts of the globe, and cross-reference historians, Jenks takes on his own rogue investigations. He does not go down the rabbit hole of conspiracy theories, nor does the show purport to solve every historical mystery. Instead, Jenks often times throws a wrench in the gears of history, getting either closer to the truth or creating more questions.

,,Music & audio,Missing Maura Murray,,"""Missing Maura Murray"" is a true crime podcast about the mysterious disappearance of Maura Murray. Maura was a 21 year old college student in February of 2004 when she inexplicably drove three hours from her dorm in Amherst, Massachusetts to the White Mountains of New Hampshire and vanished. At approximately 7:30pm her car was involved in a single car, non life threatening accident at a hairpin turn on the dark and desolate Route 112. The few witnesses who spoke with police said she denied their assistance. She was gone without a trace before the police showed up approximately ten minutes later. She has never been seen or heard from since. Now two filmmakers set out to make a documentary and find answers on this mystery by diving deep into Maura's life, the region in which she went missing, and the online world of armchair detectives.

I’m on a mission to help you stop counting down the minutes till bedtime (at least most days).

I want you to stop cleaning up after your kids’ childhood, and start being present for it - start enjoying it.

I believe in John 10:10, that we are called to abundant life, and I know mothers are NOT excluded from that promise.

Join me in conversations about simplicity, minimalism, and lots of other good stuff that leads to a life of less for the sake of enjoying more in motherhood.

“The Truth & Life Dramatized audio Bible is entirely faithful to the text of the Holy Scriptures. The manner in which the text is performed, beautifully assists the listener in understanding the meaning of the divinely inspired words within their context. The background music and sound effects helps the listener to imagine the setting of each particular text of the Holy Bible. I am happy to give my wholehearted endorsement to the audio New Testament.” 

--Cardinal Raymond L. Burke, 
Perfect of the Apostolic Signature of the Holy See 

“This is the way Scripture is supposed to sound. Revealing and passionate performances from world class actors, a lyrical translation, and sound effects that put you in the middle of the action. Whether you’ve read the Bible a hundred times or are making the first contact, this is an experience you will not forget and one you will want to repeat often.” 

--Laura Ingraham, 
Radio Talk Show Host, New York Times Bestselling Author

Simply watch TV
Caavo makes it easy for everyone to watch the best television in your home. One remote. One search. One experience. All your content.

Meet Caavo
You already have a nice television, hundreds of channels, streaming devices loaded with incredible content. But you can’t even find most of it. Meanwhile, people in your house still watch on tablets and phones because it’s easier. Not anymore. With utter simplicity and smart universal search, Caavo unlocks your best TV and all the content you've paid for, making it is as easy to enjoy as saying ""watch.""

What is Caavo
Call it what you want: a fancy HDMI switch, a TV assistant, or a voice-enabled universal remote. The real power of Caavo is that it brings together everything you already own — cable or satellite, streaming boxes or sticks, gaming consoles, DVD and Blu-ray players — unifying devices, apps, and content into one experience.

How Caavo Works
Plug everything into your Caavo - there are eight HDMI inputs - and connect your TV.  From there, Caavo does the rest.  It automatically knows which device to use, searches all your apps, finds what you want and plays it.

Google Assistant + Caavo
To get started on your Caavo, go to to Settings->Other Services->Google Home and follow the on-screen steps to pair with Google Assistant.  That’s it! 

Then, you can simply say:
“OK Google, ask Caavo to pause”
“OK Google, tell Caavo to watch CNN”
“OK Google, ask Caavo to mute”
“OK Google, tell Caavo to power off”
“OK Google, tell Caavo to find my remote”

…and Caavo will control all your TV devices, apps and content."

This smart assistant can provide you with accurate info about substance's effects, toxicity, dose information, purity testing, tolerance, safety, or drug interactions.


The philosophy behind it:
Harm Reduction is a philosophy that accepts that people will choose to use psychoactive substances and seeks to minimize any harms that may occur from those choices. Accurate information about the effects of substances, effects of different doses, and interactions with other substances is an essential part of making informed choices about substance use. Many people find themselves using substances in situations in which researching things on the internet may be the last thing on their minds. The hope of Ask The Caterpillar is that providing people with multiple ways of easily accessing substance information by texting a quick question will increase the likelihood of making an informed choice.

Other channels:
You can talk to The Caterpillar using different channels like for example messenger, slack, SMS (US only) and Telegram. Find out more on

4.2,36 users,Arts & lifestyle,Muslim Guide,,"Muslim Guide provides Islamic prayer times and recites Adan and Quran.

Muslim Guide can provide you with today's prayer times or just the time of the next prayer. It can recite the Adan and the Quran.

Features:
Here are some examples of what you can ask from your Muslim Guide:
- Say 'Get prayer times in Seattle' to get the times of the five prayers for the day in Seattle.
- Say 'Get the next prayer in New York' to get the time of the next prayer in New York.
- Say 'Recite the Adan' to hear the Adan.
- Say 'Recite Al Fatihah' or 'Recite the opener' or 'Recite Surah number 1' to hear Al-Fatihah.

Limitations:
- Google speech recognition does not recognize the surah names in Arabic, so it won't be easy to get it to identify which surah you mean. Instead, you can either say the surah order or the surah name in English. You can find the English translation of the surah names I used here at quran.com.
- Currently, Google limits the duration of the response. Long Surahs might be cut off in the middle. I am working on a workaround for this. Any suggestions are appreciated.
- You have to use 'Play' for the Adan and 'Recite' for the Surah.
- You are not able to set notifications for prayers. I am still looking into how to do this.

Tips:
Instead of having to say the whole command every time, you can set shortcuts in your Google Home App for your most used commands. For example, set a shortcut for 'Ask Muslim Guide to get Prayer Times in Seattle' as 'Get Prayer Times'.

Copyrights:
- Prayer times are obtained from muslimsalat.com
- Adan is played from islamweb.net

An astronaut, the first person to tweet from space and now a New York Times bestselling author, Mike grew up a working class kid whose seemingly unreachable dream of becoming an astronaut and going to space was realized in an unlikely journey that was driven by determination and commitment and realized with hard work and humor.

After two missions to the Hubble Telescope and four space walks to make critical repairs to the telescope, Mike is now the Senior Space Advisor to the Intrepid Sea, Air & Space Museum, a Columbia University professor, an author, a media personality, and an in-demand speaker for audiences seeking a unique perspective on teamwork, innovation, and leadership from a down to earth spaceman.

Mike has appeared on “The Big Bang Theory” six times, as well as frequent appearances on news programs, Neil deGrasse Tyson’s “Star Talk” radio and television shows, “The Late Show with David Letterman,” Craig Ferguson’s new series “Join or Die” (as well as his earlier”The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson”) and podcasts.

In addition to Mike’s numerous scholarly articles, he’s shared his unique experiences, insights and wit in his new book “Spaceman: An Astronaut’s Unlikely Journey to Unlock the Secrets of the Universe”  and with readers of a wide range of publications, including Esquire, Yahoo! Parenting and Readers Digest, to name just a few. Mike’s most recent honor was the renaming of his hometown street where he grew up to “Mike Massimino Street”!"

Welcome to the All Things Hair app, your online hair advisor! Our beauty editors at Unilever love trying out hundreds of styles and products to give you the best hair tips and inspiration.

Once you’ve enabled All Things Hair, you can explore the three key features:

1. A free search
You can ask and find out everything about any hairstyle and get specific haircare advice too. Just say what you have in mind:

‘Advice on wedding hairstyles’
‘Tell me what hairstyles look good with thin hair’
‘Show me Dutch braids’
‘Advice for summer hair color ideas’
‘Help me with dandruff’
‘How do I do natural hair updos’ 
‘How to deal with split ends’

2. Discover a new look, and find tutorials to help you

If you’re not sure about how to style your hair, we can suggest the perfect look based on your hair type, an upcoming event, or even the time of the year. If you feel inspired to try out a hairstyle, you will have access to tutorials that will guide you through the process step by step, giving you time to complete each one. You can pause & resume; it will remember where you were. 

Just say ‘inspire me’. You can always go back to searching for a new hairstyle at any time by saying ‘find another look’, or go back to the menu. 

3. Hair care and product tips 

We can give you instant access to essential hair care information and must-have products.  We can then email you the haircare advice and style guides so you can refer to them later – just say ‘Send me the look’. We can then send the products used to your inbox.

If you’d prefer to not receive emails, you can change the settings. You can turn them back on if you change your mind.

Enabling All Things Hair is simple. Tap the green ‘Install’ button on this page, enter your name & email address (so we can send you your products and tips), verify your account (click the link in the email we send), and get started with ‘Google, talk to All Things Hair!’.

For lots more handy information on how to use this skill, head to www.allthingshair.com or search ‘All Things Hair’. We hope you’ll enjoy it. If you like it, the best way to tell us is with some stars."

In some network circumstances, you may be prompted to provide additional information about your network and your Wemos to ensure the right Wemo home is being linked to your Google profile.  The account linking portal will prompt you to turn one of your Wemos ON or OFF during a 2-minute window to verify the Wemo home.  It’s easiest to physically toggle any of your connected Wemo switches using the toggle button on the Wemo hardware.
 
Once your Wemo home is verified and linked to your Google profile, you can see your Wemos listed in Home Control screen.
 
To control your devices, say “Okay, Google.  Turn on/off my <device name>.”  You can also assign Wemo devices to a room in the Google Home/Google Assistant app to control together.

Counter-protests supported the Sandinista Front government.

On Wednesday, 18 April, protests in the capital expanded in response to the Ortega - Murillo administration announcement of social security reforms that raised income and payroll taxes while reducing pension benefits by 5%. Demonstrations also emerged in six more cities, meeting with heavy response from authorities following the deployment of the Nicaraguan Army to respond to protesters ordered by President Ortega. At least 26 people were killed, including journalist Angel Gahona of the news program Meridiano, with Gahona being shot to death outside of city hall in Bluefields while streaming on Facebook Live. Reports also emerged that various forms of independent media were censored during the protests.

This is how everything started. If you want to know day by day fact about this insurrection, just ask Google!

I'm shaman and conscious lifestyle expert Alyson Charles inviting you to go on a powerful Full Moon Meditation journey with me.  I channeled this journey live and you will be taken on a deeply supportive trip to the energies of the Full Moon where you'll receive answers that will greatly empower your life and path forward, potent energetic medicine and support & deep chakra clearing/healing.

Listening to it every month at the full moon is most recommended as you will receive different answers, clarity and energies every time (full moon dates for 2018 are 01/01, 01/31, 03/01, 03/31, 04/29, 05/29, 06/28, 07/27, 08/26, 09/24, 10/24, 11/23, 12/22)

This Full Moon Meditation was created because in my many years guiding countless events and sessions, connecting with and inviting in La Luna’s gifts, it has changed many people’s lives. You may notice the positive shifts (no matter what they look like they’re unquestionably happening for your highest, greatest, Earthly good) during the meditation or the changes may take place more subtly in the days following. I simply ask that you let yourself release to the journey, trust the process, and enjoy the ride!

This meditation is accompanied by incredible Chakra Healing and clearing music from free-meditation-music.com and designed to align you with your power, truth and deep peace.

0.0,0 users,Health & fitness,The Word Bible Chat,TalkToTheWord,"TalkToTheWord is a thematic Bible concordance chat with the Parsed Interactive Bible.  You can interact with the Word using brief sentences about anything in your heart. The responses are purely in-context Scriptures.  Then the microphone will stay open waiting for you to meditate on that verse, or to discuss whatever you like - it is just between you and the Bible.  

DISCLAIMER: TalkToTheWord will stay with the MIC OPEN after each PIB verse.  So, once you are finished, please remember to say, ""OK Google, close app,"" or, ""Amen,"" to close the microphone.

The Parsed Interactive Bible is derived from the World English Bible WEB. Verses have been grouped together to preserve context and, whenever possible, to emphasise the Royal Law: (James 2:8) If you fulfill the royal law, according to the Scripture, “You shall love your neighbor as yourself,” you do well. 

No words from the World English Bible have been changed and no commentary, notes or small talk have been added so that your own response to each Scripture is inspired just by that verse alone, and by what's on your heart.  Verse numbers have been removed to encourage reading in context. Parsing has been based on meaningful sentence groups rather than the verse numbers that were added to Scripture in the 16th century. Conjunctions at the beginning of each parsed phrase and footnotes have been deleted to enhance the flow of interaction.  However, TalkToTheWord is not designed to be a stand-alone study tool.  You are encouraged to read the verses in their original context in the World English Bible or other translations for a better appreciation of the full context.

DISCLAIMER: TalkToTheWord's response to a user's input does not imply approval or agreement with that input-phrase. TalkToTheWord is powered by Dialogflow's NLU (natural language understanding) and Google's machine learning.  It automatically analyses sentence fragments and matches a limited number of key words to a concordance - a group of interrelated PIB verses.  It cannot correlate the whole meaning of the input-phrase with a specific PIB verse.  Thus, if the meaning of the whole user-input-phrase is offensive, abusive or disrespectful, TalkToTheWord is incapable of interpreting the whole meaning and so cannot be regarded as having condoned or concurred with the preceding input-phrase.  Moreover, any input-phrase following a PIB verse is purely the user's opinion and does not change the meaning or intension of the Scripture in its original context.
 
The Parsed Interactive Bible is derived solely from the World English Bible. This is is a Public Domain (no copyright) Modern English translation of the Holy Bible. That means that you may freely copy it in any form, including electronic and print formats. The World English Bible is based on the American Standard Version of the Holy Bible first published in 1901, the Biblia Hebraica Stutgartensa Old Testament, and the Greek Majority Text New Testament. It is in draft form, and currently being edited for accuracy and readability. The Parsed Interactive Bible is subject to the same Public Domain (no copyright) conditions in full."

You can set a target for any activity or measure:

""Set a target of 1800 for calories""

""Set a target of 7:00 for the 1 mile run""

""Set a weight target of 160""

Life Meter is designed to be where you are. And it's natural language interface makes tracking the things you care about a breeze. Use Facebook? Just message the Life Meter chat bot. Got Slack? There's a Life Meter bot for that too. Best of all, Life Meter works with Google Home devices, so you don't even need a phone, app, or computer to use it. Just holler across the room:

4.4,20 users,Games & fun,Deal or No Deal Unofficial,Batfia,"Can you find the case containing $1,000,000 or trick the banker into giving you more money than your case is worth?

HOW TO PLAY:
The game begins by selecting one of the 26 cases, each containing a hidden amount of money ranging from $0.01 to $1,000,000. The case you select is yours for rest of the game, and you begin to eliminate the remaining cases in a series of rounds to reveal the amount of money inside them. 

At the end of each round, the banker offers you an amount of money to buy out your case. 
No deal: If you think your case contains more than the banker's offer, you turn down the deal and continue playing the game. 🙅 
Deal: Otherwise you accept the deal, the game ends, and your case is revealed to see if you made the right choice. 
The banker's offers will change throughout the game based on the likelihood of your case containing a large or small amount of money.

Your goal is to out-smart the banker and finish the game with as much money as you possibly can, so consider the offers wisely!
And no, you will not get real money in here 😜


TIPS:
🎤 Add a shortcut for this app in our Assistant App Directory page for easy access.
🔀 Say ""random"" to pick an available case at random instead of keeping track of the case numbers.
💼 Say ""cases"" to see which cases are available to pick from
💵 Say ""amounts"" to see which cash amounts are still in play.

Seam empowers you to stay connected, letting you focus on living your life. You can record your surrounding audio, still images shot from their front and back cameras intermittently and log your GPS location data.

4.7,36 users,Education & reference,Home Classroom,Jagadish Babu,"We teach kids at a local school from time to time. We wanted to create a voice assistant that can help students take practice tests in different subjects. Google Classroom + Google Actions was the perfect environment to make this happen. Students can use this Google Action on their Phone or Google Home, and practice the question banks that teachers have created. Currently, we support Multiple Choice questions. 

How this works:
* The teacher of a class sets up question banks in Google Sheets and adds it to a class in Google Classroom. (Note: In the current version, this has to be done separately, because this assistant cannot be used to create the question bank. It can only be used to practice it.)
* The teacher should provide the Questions, Options and Answers. (Optionally, the teacher can also provide Hints) - For more details on the exact format go to the link provided below.
* When the student logs into this assistant, it will list the classes that he/she is in enrolled in. From there, the assistant will navigate them to the tests.
* You can say ""Get My Classes"" to get your classes. Then, you can select a class by saying the option like ""Science"" or ""English"", or using a number based selection like ""One"" or ""First"". You can go further and select the practice test. You could also say ""Go Back"" during the selection. 
* During a test, you can say ""Get Hint"" or ""Get Answer"", if you are not sure of the answer. You can also end the test by saying ""End Test"" and move on to another class.
* To Quit Home Classroom at any time you can say ""Quit Home Classroom"".
Note: You should be enrolled in at least one class in Google Classroom which has a practice test setup to use this action. If you would like to try out a sample class go to Google Classroom and join the classes: Science 101 (Code: c05j8w3) or English 101 (Code: 6sw9cai).
Right now this assistant is still in the ""Proof of Concept"" stage but it has the potential for future growth. It can also be used by students who are practicing for exams like GRE or GMAT. This also has the potential to be a medium to teach visually impaired kids.

In particular, the song is often sung by children on long bus trips, such as class field trips, or on Scout and/or Girl Guide outings.""

Using Google Assistant you can set the number of bottles of (root) beer on the wall at the beginning and track the number of bottles you have taken down and passed around!"

IMPORTANT PRIVACY POINT: Please note that because the app is performing an argument, it leaves the microphone open after making a statement for the other side to respond to. It is not only after a direct question to the user that the microphone is left open. The app should be regarded as a chatbot rather than a question-and-answer based service.

The argument that plays out is randomly chosen from a set of canned arguments built in to the app. You can start the argument from either side. So you can say to Alexa: ""Alexa, Open Cyber Argument"" and it will start the argument, and invoke the Cyber Argument application on Google Assistant. Alternatively, you can say to Google Assistant: ""OK Google, Talk to Cyber Argument"" and it will start the Alexa Cyber Argument skill. For this to work, please make sure the skill is enabled on Alexa.

The argument will run for about 10 rounds back and forth, until it is played out. Both devices will then close. You can stop the argument part way through by saying ""Stop"" or ""Cancel"".

The code for this app and the corresponding skill for Amazon Alexa is available on https://github.com/ArgonDesign/cyber_argument.

If you don't have both an Amazon Echo and a Google Home, you can hear the arguments step by step with just one device, by saying a short phrase such as ""Next"" where the other side would normally have spoken.

You can see a video of the system in operation at https://youtu.be/x_ZqAFnEHuM"

0.0,0 users,Education & reference,The Word Bible Reader,TalkToTheWord,"Would you like to read or listen to a Bible chapter?  The Parsed Interactive Bible PIB chapters can be searched by the book abbreviation and chapter but WITHOUT spaces or verse numbers, e.g. 1Sam1, 2Tim1 or Jam5 will return the whole chapter. Spaces or punctuation confound the natural language understanding (NLU) for exact searches.    
Or, if you want to chat to the Word, enter: Talk To The Word Bible Chat.  

The Parsed Interactive Bible is derived from the World English Bible WEB. No words from the World English Bible have been changed and no commentary, notes or small talk have been added so that your own response to each Scripture is inspired just by that verse alone, and by what's on your heart.  Verse numbers have been removed to encourage reading in context. Parsing has been based on meaningful sentence groups rather than the verse numbers that were added to Scripture in the 16th century. TalkToTheWord Bible Chat is not designed to be a stand-alone study tool.  You are encouraged to read the verses in their original context in the TalkToTheWord Bible Reader for a better appreciation of the full context.

DISCLAIMER: TalkToTheWord's response to a user's input does not imply approval or agreement with that input-phrase. TalkToTheWord is powered by Dialogflow's NLU (natural language understanding) and Google's machine learning.  It automatically analyses sentence fragments and matches a limited number of key words to a concordance - a group of interrelated PIB verses.  It cannot correlate the whole meaning of the input-phrase with a specific PIB verse.  Thus, if the meaning of the whole user-input-phrase is offensive, abusive or disrespectful, TalkToTheWord is incapable of interpreting the whole meaning and so cannot be regarded as having condoned or concurred with the preceding input-phrase.  Moreover, any input-phrase following a PIB verse is purely the user's opinion and does not change the meaning or intension of the Scripture in its original context.
 
The Parsed Interactive Bible is derived solely from the World English Bible. This is is a Public Domain (no copyright) Modern English translation of the Holy Bible. That means that you may freely copy it in any form, including electronic and print formats. The World English Bible is based on the American Standard Version of the Holy Bible first published in 1901, the Biblia Hebraica Stutgartensa Old Testament, and the Greek Majority Text New Testament. It is in draft form, and currently being edited for accuracy and readability. The Parsed Interactive Bible is subject to the same Public Domain (no copyright) conditions in full."

4.9,16 users,Education & reference,Daily Thirukkural,The Weekend Party apps,"Thirukural or shortly the Kural, is a classic Tamil text consisting of 1330 couplets or kurals, dealing with the everyday virtues of an individual. Considered one of the greatest works ever written on ethics and morality, chiefly secular ethics, it is known for its universality and non-denominational nature.It was authored by Valluvar, also known in full as Thiruvalluvar. The text has been dated variously from 300 BCE to 7th century CE. The traditional accounts describe it as the last work of the third Sangam, but linguistic analysis suggests a later date of 450-500 CE.

Traditionally praised as ""the Universal Veda,""the Kural emphasizes on the vital principles of non-violence, vegetarianism/veganism, casteless human brotherhood, absence of desires, path of righteousness and truth, and so forth, besides covering a wide range of subjects such as moral codes of rulers, friendship, agriculture, knowledge and wisdom, sobriety, love, and domestic life. Considered as chef d'oeuvre of both Indian and world literature, the Tirukkural is one of the most important works in the Tamil language. This is reflected in some of the other names by which the text is given by, such as Tamiḻ maṟai (Tamil veda), Poyyāmoḻi (words that never fail), and Deiva nūl (divine text). Translated into at least 40 languages as of 2014, the Kural is one of the most widely translated non-religious works in the world. Because the life, culture and ethics of the Tamils are considered to be solely defined in terms of the values set by the Kural, the government and the people of Tamil Nadu alike uphold the text with utmost reverence. Along with the Gita, the Kural is a prime candidate nominated to be the national book of India, for which a declaration was passed at the Tamil Nadu Assembly in 2006."

In a tire code like 255/55R15, the width is 255, the ratio is 55, and the height is 15.

For example you could say:

""Hey Google, ask Tire Comp to compare 192 + 65 + 13 with 255 + 55 + 15""

However when you are typing to Google Assistant it's probably easier to separate the numbers with spaces, so it will work when you type like this:

""Ask Tire Comp to compare 192 65 13 with 255 55 15""

When speaking the command all in one, the new tire comes first and the original tire comes second, so in these examples, 192 65 13 is the new tire and 255 55 15 is the original tire.

If you say ""ask Tire Comp to compare"" it will prompt you for the new tire and the original tire separately.

If you say ""talk to Tire Comp"", it will say hello and tell you the different commands that are available."

3.0,12 users,Productivity,Feed The Cat,Cindy & Brian Mottershead,"This app allows you to track nutrition and feeding for your cat in a very simple and straightforward way: you tell Feed the Cat when you fed your cats and the app lets you know when it is time to feed them again.   

You can say: ""I fed the cat"", and Feed the Cat remembers the time.   You can ask: ""Is it time to feed the cat"" or ""Did anybody feed the cat?""  and Feed the Cat will tell you whether it is time to feed them.

This is useful if you need a reminder about when you last fed your cats; but it is especially helpful if you have a cat on a diet, and there are several people in the household who the cat might ask for food.   If one person in the family feeds the cats and tells Feed the Cat, everybody else can know not to feed them until it is again time."

We've got your back.

CentralStation CRM is probably the easiest solution for handling all your client and contact relationships (some call it CRM) all in one place. It's build for small teams and businesses, not for large corporates.

Besides ease of use, we focus on kollaboration and the day-to-day tasks within your customer and client relationships. When did we last speak? What was I about to do? Where is that email or special file? Who was my colleague about to call before he got sick?

That said, CentralStation CRM is an operational CRM software that helps you better talk to your customers. Our focus is not so much on analytics, fancy charts that contain meaningless data most of the time.

Give it a try, we'd love to have you onboard and see you smile. And we're sure your customers will love it too."

Directives on how to interact were provided by 'scripts',  which allowed ELIZA to process user inputs and engage in discourse following the rules and directions of the script. The most famous script, DOCTOR, simulated a Rogerian psychotherapist and used rules, dictated in the script, to respond with non-directional questions to user inputs.

One swipe sends an instant call for action to the StreetSafe App users nearest to you wherever you are. StreetSafe Rescue works instantly and keeps working across 3km until 10 people are on their way to you. It guides people to you using Google Maps, has a one touch button to turn their camera on and another to call emergency services if they need to when they arrive.

Do you ever find yourself walking down a street in the dark, going back to your car in a car park or taking the short cut home? Do you worry about what might happen and how you would call for help? StreetSafe Rescue is the personal alarm that gets noticed and gets a reaction. It will bring people to you quickly, allowing them to help or call emergency services if needed.

Once you swipe to alert other people, the next screen gives a swipe to call emergency services, so people are on their way to you whilst you are talking to the police.
It includes a free option to alert 5 named contacts at the same time the alert goes to the people nearby. You don’t have to call anyone else. You can concentrate on dealing with the situation around you.

If there’s an intruder in your home or someone trying to steal your car, one swipe will alert 15 of your neighbours. That’s 15 who are in, not those who’ve already left for work or are away on holiday. Family, friends, neighbours, colleagues and teammates will all help if they know there’s an emergency. StreetSafe Rescue is how you get in touch.

After an incident is resolved, all responders get a reference number in their history so they can upload evidence to our system later when they have time. And just in case they’ve got lost, there’s a button to load map directions back to where they started.

If you need to report the incident to the police, give them the StreetSafe Rescue incident number and they can access all of the pictures, video or written evidence that everyone uploads. This is the evidence that will help get a conviction.

If someone near you needs urgent help you might get an alert. You don’t need special skills and you won’t be alone. Just showing up could make a huge difference to someone’s life in their moment of need.

£1.99 per year. No in-app purchases. Download StreetSafe Rescue now and tell your family, friends, neighbours, colleagues and teammates. So you can be on your own but not alone."

Imagine if your child could listen to his grandfather’s stories at bedtime.

Here’s what’s available from IVOW on Google’s Assistant on Google Home devices:

You can listen to a collection of stories from our beta IVOW storyteller.
Just talk to IVOW from your Google Home device. To begin with, ask your Google Assistant to open IVOW (pronounced I-vow)

Then say, “Hey Google, ask IVOW to share a story from your database.""

or ""Hey Google, ask IVOW to share a story in a different language.""
or ""Hey Google, ask IVOW to share a story about Mexican-American heritage.""
​or ""Hey Google, ask IVOW to share a story about Artificial Intelligence for Good.""

IVOW (www.ivow.ai) is building an AI-cultural database -- focusing on making natural language processing and machine learning more inclusive. “AI cultural algorithms need to be a reflection of who we are,” says Davar Ardalan, founder of IVOW. “As we move into an era of automated intelligent storytelling as opposed to centralized platforms, we need to diversify data now. Effective fusion of AI with cultural storytelling will help diminish bias in algorithmic identification and train AI software to be much more inclusive.”"
