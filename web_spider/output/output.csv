3.9,11 users,Arts & lifestyle,The Wise Caterpillar,,"Ask The Caterpillar is a harm reduction assistant that allows people easy access to information about substances so that they can make informed choices. 

This smart assistant can provide you with accurate info about substance's effects, toxicity, dose information, purity testing, tolerance, safety, or drug interactions.


The philosophy behind it:
Harm Reduction is a philosophy that accepts that people will choose to use psychoactive substances and seeks to minimize any harms that may occur from those choices. Accurate information about the effects of substances, effects of different doses, and interactions with other substances is an essential part of making informed choices about substance use. Many people find themselves using substances in situations in which researching things on the internet may be the last thing on their minds. The hope of Ask The Caterpillar is that providing people with multiple ways of easily accessing substance information by texting a quick question will increase the likelihood of making an informed choice.

Other channels:
You can talk to The Caterpillar using different channels like for example messenger, slack, SMS (US only) and Telegram. Find out more on

Buddhist sermons are such simple and enlightening that one does not need to be a Buddhist. The preachings create a positive vibe and energy in people who listen to them, and encourage them to lead a better life and do good deeds.

Some feel good Buddhist preachings on the Speaking Buddha are:

·       We ordinary people can see neither our own eyelashes, which are so close, nor the heavens in the distance. Likewise, we do not see that the Buddha exists in our own hearts.

·       If the minds of living beings are impure, their land is also impure, but if their minds are pure, so is their land. There are not two lands, pure or impure in themselves. The difference lies solely in the good or evil of our minds.

·       Suffer what there is to suffer, enjoy what there is to enjoy. Regard both suffering and joy as facts of life, and continue chanting Nam Myoho Renge Kyo, no matter what happens. How could this be anything other than the boundless joy of the Law?

·       Your practice of the Buddhist teachings will not relieve you of the sufferings of birth and death in the least unless you perceive the true nature of your life. If you seek enlightenment outside yourself, then your performing even ten thousand practices and ten thousand good deeds will be in vain.

·       Just as cherry, plum, peach and damson blossoms all possess their own unique qualities, each person is unique. We cannot become someone else. The important thing is that we live true to ourselves and cause the great flower of our lives to blossom.

·       Before comparing yourself with others, win the battle with yourself. Strive to be better today than yesterday, and better tomorrow than today."

In a tire code like 255/55R15, the width is 255, the ratio is 55, and the height is 15.

For example you could say:

""Hey Google, ask Tire Comp to compare 192 + 65 + 13 with 255 + 55 + 15""

However when you are typing to Google Assistant it's probably easier to separate the numbers with spaces, so it will work when you type like this:

""Ask Tire Comp to compare 192 65 13 with 255 55 15""

When speaking the command all in one, the new tire comes first and the original tire comes second, so in these examples, 192 65 13 is the new tire and 255 55 15 is the original tire.

If you say ""ask Tire Comp to compare"" it will prompt you for the new tire and the original tire separately.

If you say ""talk to Tire Comp"", it will say hello and tell you the different commands that are available."

4.2,36 users,Arts & lifestyle,Muslim Guide,,"Muslim Guide provides Islamic prayer times and recites Adan and Quran.

Muslim Guide can provide you with today's prayer times or just the time of the next prayer. It can recite the Adan and the Quran.

Features:
Here are some examples of what you can ask from your Muslim Guide:
- Say 'Get prayer times in Seattle' to get the times of the five prayers for the day in Seattle.
- Say 'Get the next prayer in New York' to get the time of the next prayer in New York.
- Say 'Recite the Adan' to hear the Adan.
- Say 'Recite Al Fatihah' or 'Recite the opener' or 'Recite Surah number 1' to hear Al-Fatihah.

Limitations:
- Google speech recognition does not recognize the surah names in Arabic, so it won't be easy to get it to identify which surah you mean. Instead, you can either say the surah order or the surah name in English. You can find the English translation of the surah names I used here at quran.com.
- Currently, Google limits the duration of the response. Long Surahs might be cut off in the middle. I am working on a workaround for this. Any suggestions are appreciated.
- You have to use 'Play' for the Adan and 'Recite' for the Surah.
- You are not able to set notifications for prayers. I am still looking into how to do this.

Tips:
Instead of having to say the whole command every time, you can set shortcuts in your Google Home App for your most used commands. For example, set a shortcut for 'Ask Muslim Guide to get Prayer Times in Seattle' as 'Get Prayer Times'.

Copyrights:
- Prayer times are obtained from muslimsalat.com
- Adan is played from islamweb.net
